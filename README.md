# class-2022-08-11

Repo for class work on August 11. Try to make the resulting website look like a good final project. Some thoughts:

* Edit the About page. Include your Github, email contact. Also, provide a link to https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/. Also, include information about your data.

* Edit the home page so that it looks nicer. Get rid of all the default text. Very embarassing to have that included. Write the key paragraph.
